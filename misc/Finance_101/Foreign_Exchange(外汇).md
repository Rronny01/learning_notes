# 外汇交易业务基础知识

FX is a continuous global business which we say operates on a 24 by 5.5 schedule – 24 hours a day, 5 and a half days a week.

The trading week begins with Wellington New Zealand open on Monday morning at 4am JST, and runs until NYC Close at 5:00pm EST on Friday afternoon (Sun 15:00 EST – Fri 17:00 EST).

Volume goes much higher during economic events or announcements which lead to currency volatility.
